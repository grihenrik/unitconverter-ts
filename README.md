# Unit Converter
This is a simple unit converter example created for a school course in webframeworks 2020. The converter is extensible 
with new coverters and types.
At this stage it contains mainly temperature and distance converters. The extension mechanism is quite simple just 
copy one of the existing converters.
To get the converter to find the new converter you need to add it to the application manually. 

## Installation
Just clone the converter to a local directory, cd into it and run NPM install, when NPM install is ready you can try
it out with npm run project. 
Running NPM run build will build the project
